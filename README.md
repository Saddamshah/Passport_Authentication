# Authentication with Passport.js


This Application is simple login system where you can ragister as a new user and login  you account once you logged in 
then only you are able to see dashboard.
      
If you try to go dashboard route without having a login you redirect to login page because i had used middleware 
to check user are login or not And you cannot register if the mail id allready exist. you have to use  another 
email if order to make a new account.
      
 This Login stytem is build on Javascript for backend I used Node.js Express.js and for database I used MongoDB atlas. 
 Authentication is created using Passport.js local Strategy.
